SinjDoc is written in JSR-14 v2.2 Java and requires the prototype version 2.2
JSR-14 compiler to build.  Later versions may work, too.  Download it from
 http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/adding_generics/index.html
or see
 http://cscott.net/Projects/GJ/
for up-to-date news on JSR-14 java.

You will also need the 'gjc-rt.jar' stubs distributed with the JSR-14
compiler on your bootclasspath.  The best way to do this is to use the
'java' script distributed with the JSR-14 prototype.

The ./configure script will look for a JSR-14 compiler by first trying
'jikes' and 'javac' in your path and looking at the environment variable
'JSR14DISTR', which you should have set as part of the installation of
the Sun prototype compiler.  You can explicitly specify the path to
a JSR-14 java compiler by setting the environment variable JCC.

When you have installed the JSR-14 compiler, you need only do:
 ./autogen.sh  # only if you're using CVS; see README for more info
 ./configure
 make
To test:
 make doc

SinjDoc is invoked using the same command line arguments as javadoc:
 $JSR14DISTR/scripts/java -jar sinjdoc.jar <javadoc options>
Make sure either the SinjDoc build directory or lib/cup.jar:lib/jutil.jar
is in your classpath.

You may find something similar to the following shell script useful to place
in your path:
---- ~/bin/sinjdoc ---
#!/bin/sh
$JSR14DISTR/scripts/java -Xmx200M -ea -cp $HOME/Projects/SinjDoc -jar $HOME/Projects/SinjDoc/sinjdoc.jar "$@"
