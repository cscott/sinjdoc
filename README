This directory contains java sources for the SinjDoc documentation tool.
SinjDoc expands to "SinjDoc is not javadoc" -- it's better!
[If recursion isn't your thing, you can alternatively expand SinjDoc to
 "Scott's Improved and New JavaDoc".  That's nicer, now, isn't it?]

If you've grabbed the sources from CVS, you'll want to run ./autogen.sh
to let autoheader/autoconf/automake do their thing.  This is not necessary
if you're using a release distributed as a .tar.gz file.

See the INSTALL file for generic build instructions;
the BUILDING file has more specific information.
