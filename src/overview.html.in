This document is the API specification for version @PACKAGE_VERSION@
of the @PACKAGE_NAME@ tool, which
is a javadoc replacement that handles JSR-14 (generic java)
source code.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ defines a 'Doclet' and 'Taglet' interface
similar to, but not identical with, that defined by Sun's javadoc
tool.  Some incompatibilities are forced by the addition of
parameterized types, and others were introduced to clean up
or restructure the interface in places where I found it lacking.
